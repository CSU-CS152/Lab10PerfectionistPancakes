# Lab10PerfectionistPancakes
Recursion Warmup Lab

You have been hired as a new employee at a perfectionist-run cafe. The owners are very particular about how they like things organized, so they have decided to implement a robot to do some of the work for them. You are in charge of coding the robot. Attached is some of the code you have already written.

Read through the code and answer the following questions:

1. What is the output for onePlateToAnother?

2. What is the output for onePlateToAnother([“blueberry”, “strawberry”, “choco chip”]?

3. What is main() doing?
	
4. What is the output for main() when this is the input?:
maple
Y
strawberry 
y 
birthday cake
n 
double chocolate



5. Now it’s your turn! Write a function that takes in the initial number of orders and a list of orders (this will be a list of strings) and then RECURSIVELY prints each order and says “Order #___, your order of ___ pancakes is up!”
Example of how this function would be used: orderUp(3, [“blueberry, strawberry”, “plain, whole wheat”, “banana nut, birthday cake, chocolate chip”])
(the output would be:
“Order #1, your order of [“blueberry”, “strawberry”] pancakes is up!”
“Order #2, your order of [“plain”, “whole wheat”] pancakes is up!”
“Order #3, your order of [“banana nut”, “birthday cake”, “chocolate chip”] pancakes is up!” )
(Hint: there is already a function for turning strings into lists)
